## Meeting 3.

* **DATE: 10/03/2023**
* **ASSISTANTS: Mika Oja**

### Minutes

Revision and grading of the deliverable for Deadline 3, discussion about using database IDs in the URL.

### Action points

 - In the "Uniform Interface" wiki section state that PUT 'replaces' a resource instead of updating it. This doesn't have any effect on our implementation since we don't have optional fields.
 - Debate whether to use `course_code` in the URl for courses, to avoid exposing database IDs. We can't do that at the moment for students since the only other unique field is the Social Security Number.
