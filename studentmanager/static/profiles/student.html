<h1>StudentManager API: Student Profile</h1>

In the API, a Student resource represents the personal data of a student enrolled at the University.
It holds the following attributes:

<ul>
    <li><b>first_name</b>: the student's first name. It is a string limited to 64 characters in length.</li>
    <li><b>last_name</b>: the student's last name. It is a string limited to 64 characters in length.</li>
    <li><b>date_of_birth</b>: the student's date of birth. It is stored as an SQLAlchemy.Date. It is inputted to and
        outputted from the API as a standard ISO date ('yyyy-mm-dd'). It has to be in the past with respect to day it is
        inserted.
    </li>
    <li><b>ssn</b>: the student's Social Security Number in Finnish format. It is a string of exactly 11 characters.
        Validation has to pass for the SSN's format, and its coherence with the date_of_birth attribute. It has to be
        unique.
    </li>
</ul>
All attributes are mandatory when adding or modyfing a student. A complete JSON schema for tudents can be obtained from the Student.json_schema method, or by the hypermedia controls related to adding or modyfing students.
<br/><br/>
Each student also has a profile picture, that can be reached at the URL contained in the "studman:propic" hypermedia control.

<h2>Endpoints</h2>


All students are stored in the StudentCollection resource (/api/students/). This collection allows to add new students to the database.
<br/><br/>

Individual students can be accessed from the StudentItem resource (/api/students/&lt;student_id&gt;/). This resource allows editing and deletion of an individual student.
<br/>
It also allows access to the student's assessment collection (/api/students/&lt;student_id&gt;/assessments/).
<br/><br/>
A prototype ProfilePictureItem is also implemented. It will display the user's profile picture (the same for all students for now) and expose hypermedia controls to return to the StudentItem resource.

<h2>Relevant link relations</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>self</b>: carried by all Collections and Items returned by the API. In particular, each student returned by
        the StudentCollection will carry it.
    </li>
    <li><b>profile</b>: points to this page.</li>
    <li><b>collection</b>: points from each Item resource to the respective Collection. (i.e. StudentItem resources will
        point to the StudentCollection).
    </li>
    <li><b>studman:courses-all, studman:assessments-all</b>: point to the other two main Collections in our API
        structure: CourseCollection and AssessmentCollection.
    </li>
    <li><b>studman:add-student</b>: carried by StudentCollection, pointing to itself specifying the POST method and the
        required Student json schema.
    </li>
    <li><b>edit, studman:delete</b>: carried by StudentItem, pointing to itself with PUT and DELETE methods
        respectively.
    </li>
    <li><b>studman:student</b>: carried by the StudentAssessmentCollection resource, points to the relevant Student.
        (Also carried by the ProfilePictureItem resource, points to the relevant Student).
    </li>
    <li><b>studman:student-assessments</b>: inverse of the previous control, carried by a StudentItem, points to the
        relevant StudentAssessmentCollection.
    </li>
    <li><b>studman:propic</b>: this link points from the StudentItem endpoint to the corresponding ProfilePictureItem
        URL
    </li>
</ul>
