<h1>CourseManager API: Assessment Profile</h1>

In the API, an Assessment resource represents the information of an assessment a student received for a course.
It holds the following attributes:

<ul>
    <li><b>course_id</b>: the course_id of the course this assessment is related to. It is an integer value that <em>must</em>
        refer to an existing course.
    </li>
    <li><b>student_id</b>: the student_id of the student that has completed this asseessment. It is an integer value
        that <em>must</em> refer to an existing student.
    </li>
    <li><b>grade</b>: the grade the student received during the assessment. It is an integer value ranging from 0 to 5,
        with 0 representing a Fail grade.
    </li>
    <li><b>date</b>: the date the assessment has been carried on. It is stored as an SQLAlchemy.Date. It is inputted to
        and outputted from the API as a standard ISO date ('yyyy-mm-dd'). It cannot be in the future with respect to the
        day it is inserted.
    </li>
</ul>
All attributes are mandatory when adding or modyfing an assessment. A complete JSON schema for assessments can be obtained from the Assessment.json_schema method, or by the hypermedia controls related to adding or modyfing assessments.
<br/>
The pair of course_id and student_id uniquely identifies the assessment.

<h2>Endpoints</h2>


All assessments are stored in the AssessmentCollection resource (/api/assessments/). This collection allows to add new assessments to the database.
<br/><br/>

Individual assessments can be accessed from the StudentAssessmentItem or CourseAssessmentItem resources (/api/courses/&lt;course_id&gt;/assessments/&lt;student_id&gt;/ or /api/cstudents/&lt;student_id&gt;/assessments/&lt;course_id&gt;/). This resource allows editing and deletion of an individual assessment.
<br/>
It also allows access to the parent assessment collection (/api/courses/&lt;course_id&gt;/assessments/ or /api/students/&lt;student_id&gt;/assessments/).

<h2>Relevant link relations</h2>

<ul>
    <li><b>self</b>: carried by all Collections and Items returned by the API. In particular, each assessment returned
        by the AssessmentCollection will carry it, pointing to a CourseAssessmentItem resource.
    </li>
    <li><b>profile</b>: points to this page.</li>
    <li><b>collection</b>: points from each Item resource to the respective Collection. (i.e. AssessmentItem resources
        will point to the AssessmentCollection).
    </li>
    <li><b>edit, studman:delete</b>: carried by StudentItem, pointing to itself with PUT and DELETE methods
        respectively.
    </li>
    <li><b>studman:students-all, studman:courses-all</b>: point to the other two main Collections in our API structure:
        StudentCollection and CourseCollection.
    </li>
    <li><b>studman:add-assessment</b>: carried by AssessmentCollection, pointing to itself specifying the POST method
        and the required Assessment json schema.
    </li>
    <li><b>studman:student, studman:course</b>: carried by all assessment collections and items. Point to the related
        student or course, when applicable (e.g. StudentAssessmentCollection will only hold the studman:student
        control).
    </li>
</ul>
