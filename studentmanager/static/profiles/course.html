<h1>CourseManager API: Course Profile</h1>

In the API, a Course resource represents the information of a course offered by the University.
It holds the following attributes:

<ul>
    <li><b>title</b>: the course's title. It is a string limited to 255 characters in length.</li>
    <li><b>teacher</b>: the name of the course's teacher. It is a string limited to 255 characters in length.</li>
    <li><b>code</b>: the course's unique code. It is a string limited to 12 characters in length.</li>
    <li><b>ects</b>: the amount of ECTS the course grants upon completion. It is an integer value.</li>
</ul>
All attributes are mandatory when adding or modyfing a course. A complete JSON schema for courses can be obtained from the Course.json_schema method, or by the hypermedia controls related to adding or modyfing courses.

<h2>Endpoints</h2>


All courses are stored in the CourseCollection resource (/api/courses/). This collection allows to add new courses to the database.
<br/><br/>

Individual courses can be accessed from the CourseItem resource (/api/courses/&lt;course_id&gt;/). This resource allows editing and deletion of an individual course.
<br/>
It also allows access to the course's assessment collection (/api/courses/&lt;course_id&gt;/assessments/).
